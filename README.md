# Microsoft API's for Digital Justice

This is a repository that groups together a bunch of API's definitions availabe in Microsoft Graph (it includes O365 and Microsoft Teams) that could be easily leveraged in the context of third-party applications in the **Digital Justice** space.

The intent of this effort is to facilitate and speed up the integration process between Microsoft's products and services with third-party applications brought to the market by Microsoft's partners and customers in Digital Justice.
